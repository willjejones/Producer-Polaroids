I"<p>This week I produced a recording (and accompanying video!) of a little ditty that I wrote a couple of years ago, but never came back to and never fully flushed out. I decided that this would be the challenge of this weeks polaroid:</p>

<p>I kept the feel and style of the original, as well as keeping the same lyrics and melody for the vocal line. The bassline was also unchanged, although I decided that I wanted to try plucking it on cello, which ended up being something I really liked. I then also used the cello to add some drones later on in the track, giving the other parts a nice velvety backdrop on which to feature.</p>

<p>When I wrote the song, I had this idea for a breakdown/bridge section, (only for a couple of bars), that had a change in tempo, change in time signature and some fast chord changes to break up the almost slurring verse. At the time, I only got so far as the melody line to lead through the section, but found the rest of the parts a little too tricky to nail down. So this time round, I spent a bit of time figuring out what that would look like. The result is a raise in tempo and a change from 4/4 into 11/8 time - something that probably ought not to work, but I think generally sounds good overall!</p>
