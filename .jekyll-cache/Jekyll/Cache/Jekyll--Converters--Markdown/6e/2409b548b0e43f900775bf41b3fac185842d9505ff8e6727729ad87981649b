        My Mum is an avid knitter, and she recently decided to start selling all of her excess inventory of baby knitwear. As this was a casual venture she only really needed an Instagram page to market the clothes, and then some business cards to spread the account. Both of these things needed consistent branding and a unique logo - this is where I come in.
