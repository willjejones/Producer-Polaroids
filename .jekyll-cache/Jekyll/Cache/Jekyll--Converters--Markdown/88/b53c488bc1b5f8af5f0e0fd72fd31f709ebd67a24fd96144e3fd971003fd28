I")<p>Myself and best friend/frequent creative collaborator of mine, James, set ourselves a new creative project over the weekend: to remake the video (with covered audio) of Patrick Watson’s new single “Dream for Dreaming”.</p>

<p>Since this was a small weekend project for our own entertainment, we decided to challenge ourselves with a rough £10 budget. Given that we already had the camera and music recording equipment, that money went into buying the materials for our attempt at recreating a similar puppet to the one’s used by Patrick Watson. Here is what we came up with (credit to James for most of the puppet build):</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="http://localhost:4000/public/assets/puppets/puppet.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Puppet" />
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="http://localhost:4000/public/assets/puppets/puppet2.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Puppet" />
    </div>
</div>

<p>I found some bright blue wrapping paper that conveniently acted as the background for our chroma keying (green-screen).</p>
