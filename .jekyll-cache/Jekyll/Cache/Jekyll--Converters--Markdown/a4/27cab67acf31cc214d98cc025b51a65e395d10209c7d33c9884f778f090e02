I"´<p>And so it begins! I spent a little longer on this track than intended, but Iâ€™m pleased with how it came out. I had a lot of fun making the groove, and that gave me an excuse to work in some sax, something Iâ€™ve neglected for a little while.</p>

<p>The first sound I put down was the velvety electric piano, which when combined with the punchy bassline, really set the tone for the rest of the track. Finding the accompanying beat and then layering some simple guitar picking over top felt like it rounded off the base groove.</p>

<p>I then kept swapping back and forth between leaving it as an instrumental track, or adding a vocal line. I couldnâ€™t work out which I preferred so I just ignored the problem and did both! The result is a short vocal verse followed by a solo on my alto sax which I think really completes the vibe.</p>
