<p>This song started with some jamming on my Maschine MK3 - often I’ll take a looped idea from an MK3 session and bring it into Ableton to flesh it out more. I challenged myself with this one to create the sound I wanted using just synths, drums, vocals and no guitars (excluding bass), as they tend to be something I lean on for the backbone of a song. The creation of this was fairly rushed, so I’m not sure it’s my best work, but there are definitely a few different ideas I’d like to come back to and explore in the future.</p>
