<p>Well, this is my excuse for ripping off Ruth Jacksonâ€™s unique card design idea to make for my friends and family. Itâ€™s a quick an easy process, that looks cutesy and artisanal, and the concept can be easily extended to any drawings/ideas.</p>

        My Mum is an avid knitter, and she recently decided to start selling all of her excess inventory of baby knitwear. This is a casual venture; she only really needed an Instagram page to market the clothes, and then some business cards to spread the account. Both of these things needed consistent branding and a unique logo - this is where I come in.
