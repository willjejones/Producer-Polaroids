I"€<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Create, document and release 1 track a week for the next 42 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-doing-this">Why am I doing this?</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve wanted to release a (fairly amateur and hobbyist) EP/LP for the last 5 years or so, and over that time I have created over 100 track ideas but never once felt they were finished and therefore ready to share with the world.</p>

<p>So really, the sole objective of this project is to defeat the perfectionist within me. I have a real issue with finishing work that isnâ€™t the highest quality output that I <em>think</em> I can produce. I finish very little and release even less. I think spending an afternoon/evening on a track and just releasing the idea and letting go will help in combatting my issues. Plus, I think the project will help me to:</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li>Explore a broad range of genres, both instrumental and vocal tracks. Iâ€™m hoping as a side product of this that I have a much better understanding of what my strengths/weaknesses are and help shape and inspire the sound for a first release.</li>
  <li>Force myself to approach creativity from new angles - using new sounds, production tools and instruments.</li>
  <li>(Hopefully) make me a better creator/producer/musician/composer as a result, with a whole new armoury of creative weapons at my disposal; all the ideas I generate from this can be fleshed out and explored in bigger, future tracks.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-with-the-name">Whatâ€™s with the name?</h2>

<p>Although it sounds like a photography project (confusing, sorry), itâ€™s meant to encapsulate the principle of the work; polaroids are one time disposable pictures, you spend a short amount of time setting up and framing the photo and then snap the shot. The output is then finished and (almost) instantly released and shared with the world. I want my approach to music creation and production to follow this theme - not rushed, but completed in a reasonable time period and released at the point when Iâ€™ve captured enough of the idea.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-making-this-public">Why am I making this public?</h2>

<p>Simply put, sharing the continual output of this project will actually force me to stick to it, and see it through to the end. And then itâ€™s an added bonus if people enjoy any of the tracks!</p>

<h2 id="what-is-each-track-going-to-look-like">What is each track going to look like?</h2>

<p>In short, anything. There will be no fixed rule in how I approach creating and producing a track. Roughly speaking, tracks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>may just be a short 16 bar soundscape all the way through to a 3/4 min song complete with lyrics.</li>
  <li>could be inspired by a sound Iâ€™ve been listening to recently, a new instrument Iâ€™m playing with, or even a picture/animation/film that I would like to create a â€˜soundtrackâ€™ for.</li>
  <li>wonâ€™t really be mastered or have any real professional grade production, but enough hopefully to make it listenable!</li>
  <li>may feature some friends if any are interested in collaborating</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-42-weeks">Why 42 weeks?</h2>

<p>There are 42 weeks until the end of 2019 and I like convenient ends.</p>
