Between now and the completion of my final year project, I will be using this blog format as a project log that I will update with:

* Weekly supervisor meeting notes
* Informal working notes
* Potential design ideas and discussion
* References and summaries of any relevant papers I read throughout the project
* Regular progress updates

_(Each post will be tagged as a category of one of the above)._

The actual code implementation and the accompanying documentation for the project will be kept in a private GitHub repository, whilst the progress of these will be regularly communicated through this blog style project log.
