## Goal: Create, document and release 1 track a week for the next 42 weeks.
## Why am I doing this?

I’ve wanted to release a (fairly amateur and hobbyist) EP/LP for the last 5 years or so, and over that time I have created over 100 track ideas but never once felt they were finished and therefore ready to share with the world.

So really, the sole objective of this project is to defeat the perfectionist within me. I have a real issue with finishing work that isn’t the highest quality output that I *think* I can produce. I finish very little and release even less. I think spending an afternoon/evening on a track and just releasing the idea and letting go will help in combatting my issues. Plus, I think the project will help me to:


- Explore a broad range of genres, both instrumental and vocal tracks. I’m hoping as a side product of this that I have a much better understanding of what my strengths/weaknesses are and help shape and inspire the sound for a first release.
- Force myself to approach creativity from new angles - using new sounds, production tools and instruments.
- (Hopefully) make me a better creator/producer/musician/composer as a result, with a whole new armoury of creative weapons at my disposal; all the ideas I generate from this can be fleshed out and explored in bigger, future tracks.


## What’s with the name?

Although it sounds like a photography project (confusing, sorry), it’s meant to encapsulate the principle of the work; polaroids are one time disposable pictures, you spend a short amount of time setting up and framing the photo and then snap the shot. The output is then finished and (almost) instantly released and shared with the world. I want my approach to music creation and production to follow this theme - not rushed, but completed in a reasonable time period and released at the point when I’ve captured enough of the idea.


## Why am I making this public?

Simply put, sharing the continual output of this project will actually force me to stick to it, and see it through to the end. And then it’s an added bonus if people enjoy any of the tracks!


## What is each track going to look like?

In short, anything. There will be no fixed rule in how I approach creating and producing a track. Roughly speaking, tracks:

- may just be a short 16 bar soundscape all the way through to a 3/4 min song complete with lyrics.
- could be inspired by a sound I’ve been listening to recently, a new instrument I’m playing with, or even a picture/animation/film that I would like to create a ‘soundtrack’ for.
- won’t really be mastered or have any real professional grade production, but enough hopefully to make it listenable!
- may feature some friends if any are interested in collaborating


## Why 42 weeks?

There are 42 weeks until the end of 2019 and I like convenient ends.
