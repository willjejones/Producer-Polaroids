Fifth supervisor meeting of the Michaelmas Term. _Will Jones and Dr Steven Bradley_

>Progress
>---
* Look at jMusic for “theory”: seems good, made simple link with SC
* Generate OSC from C#/Kinect? 

>Targets for next time
>---
* Read up on what should be in design document
* Kinect -> Java -> Sc: try this now with jMusic:
	- play a single note (or chord)
	- change note/chord that is being played repeatedly
	- change the rhythm that is being used for a chord
	- change volume of notes (and other characteristics)
	- control effects
	- change instrumentation
	- control looper
* Have a look at timed automata in UPPAAL as a means to represent high-level structures in the music www.uppaal.com for case studies

>Issues
>---
* Choice of protocol: OSC? Looking positive
* How to represent music and where: maybe jFugue, definitely Java.

>Deadlines

* Design report draft 30th November

>Next meeting
