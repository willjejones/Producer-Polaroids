Thirteenth supervisor meeting of the Michaelmas Term. _Will Jones and Dr Steven Bradley_

>Progress
>---
* Chords and bass playing in time triggered by Java rendered by SC
* Long notes too
* Synth for each note, nodeID passed back from SC to Java so it can be turned off
* Front end to simulate gestures with key presses: change between chords
* Sample track: chord progression
* Fixed bug with multiple parameters on OSC

>Targets for next time
>---
* Join up gestures from kinect to control an existing chord progression, swiping
* Do this with a sax
* Think about routing some gestures directly to SC e.g. pan, effect etc
* Experiment to identify a vocabulary of gestures

>Issues
>---
*GUI for setup and/or performance monitoring

>Next meeting

* 4.00 Monday 15th Feb
