Recently I've been playing around with the Maschine MK3 as a live jamming tool. With the piano riff from Everything Everything's A Fever Dream stuck in my head for the last few days, I decided to have a go at covering the song in a live looped performance.

In my wider music production, my Maschine tends to be used as a tool to generate ideas and soundscapes. It's a fast process to get my concepts down and then easy to build up layers and beats around that. I then tend to move these ideas into Ableton and start to form up what I've made into more of a defined song.

But more recently, I've discovered that a lot of the Maschine has been designed with performance in mind, and this is something I've been playing around with a little bit. As soon as a laid down the riff from A Fever Dream, I knew it would be a good format to try it on. The end result was this one-take live performance in the video above!
