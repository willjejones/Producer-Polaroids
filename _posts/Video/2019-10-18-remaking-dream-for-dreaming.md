Myself and best friend/frequent creative collaborator of mine, James, set ourselves a new creative project over the weekend: to remake the video (with covered audio) of Patrick Watson's new single "Dream for Dreaming".

Since this was a small weekend project for our own entertainment, we decided to challenge ourselves with a rough Â£10 budget. Given that we already had the camera and music recording equipment, that money went into buying the materials for our attempt at recreating a similar puppet to the one's used by Patrick Watson. Here is what we came up with (credit to James for most of the puppet build):

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/public/assets/puppets/puppet.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Puppet">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="{{ site.url }}/public/assets/puppets/puppet2.png" style="width: 100%" alt="Puppet">
    </div>
</div>

I found some bright blue wrapping paper that conveniently acted as the background to film against (for the purpose of chroma keying, i.e. a green screen). It was then a case of creating a list of shots we needed to replicate, and then filming those until we had enough material to edit into the final video.
