<p>
It is turning off the light, and staring into the darkness.<br>
Searching for shapes in the emptiness.<br>
Asking your eyes to latch on to something. <br> Anything.<br>
And then finding stability.
</p>

<p>
It is tumbling in the surf, from the impact of a stray wave.<br>
Fumbling the pebbled floor with panicked hands.<br>
Asking your body to orientate itself with something.<br> Anything.<br>
And then finding stability.
</p>

<p>
It is waking from a dream, caught in a moment of lucidity.<br>
Questioning the line between imagination and reality.<br>
Asking your mind to make sense of something. <br> Anything. <br>
And then finding stability.
</p>

<p>
It is refusing to settle, in the rhythmic cycle of monotony.<br>
Deciphering meaning and direction as it comes.<br>
Asking yourself to gamble on something. <br> Anything.<br>
But then losing stability.
</p>
