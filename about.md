<p class="message">
This is a place for me to store snapshots of the random assortment of creative personal projects that I get up to in my spare time, (presented in a blog style format).
<br>
<br> Each post is a 'polaroid' that records the project, whether it's a short poem or the breakdown of a personal programming challenge I attempted. It's really just a way for me to document all of the ideas and work I do as a hobbyist producer and maker.
