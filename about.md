<p class="message">
I’ve wanted to release a (fairly amateur and hobbyist) EP/LP for the last 5 years or so, and over that time I have created over 100 track ideas but never once felt they were finished and therefore ready to share with the world.

So really, the sole objective of this project is to defeat the perfectionist within me. I have a real issue with finishing work that isn’t the highest quality output that I think I can produce. I finish very little and release even less. I think spending an afternoon/evening on a track and just releasing the idea and letting go will help in combatting my issues.

Thus, this project was born!
